# Simple CIFAR-10 Neural Network for UROP 2018
Simple convolutional neural network for my 2018 UROP

### Training
Run train.py with the model path as a parameter
Default path is '/tmp/cifar10_model'

### Prediction
Run predict.py with the image path as its first parameter (must be 32x32 RGB) and model path as its second
